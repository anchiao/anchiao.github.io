## Introduction

In today's cloud-driven world, AWS has become the go-to platform for developers. With its wide range of services, from compute and storage to networking and databases, AWS offers everything you need to build and deploy scalable, reliable applications.

If you're a developer looking to boost your career, earning the AWS Certified Developer certification is a great place to start. This industry-recognized credential validates your skills and knowledge in AWS, giving you a competitive edge in the job market.

## Why Get AWS Certified?
This certification allows you to showcase your expertise to potential employers and clients, setting you apart in a competitive field. It can help you secure higher salaries, better job opportunities, and more chances for advancement. My previous employer highly valued AWS certifications, often encouraging employees to participate in AWS courses and offering to cover the full cost of the exam fees upon passing, highlighting the value placed on AWS skills.

From a personal perspective, preparing for the AWS Certified Developer exam through systematic learning and organization not only made me more familiar with cloud architecture services but also enhanced my understanding of system architecture.

For example, understanding various messaging patterns in AWS SQS, such as FIFO Queue, Standard Queue, Fanout, Delay Queue, Deadletter Queue, has broadened my expertise beyond AWS-specific systems, making me more proficient in using other MQ systems as well.

During an interview, I was asked how to deploy a new version of a system. I simply answered, "Deploy a new system and use a proxy to redirect traffic to it before cutting off the old system." However, after learning about AWS Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation, I realized there are many deployment strategies like Blue/Green, Canary, Linear, Immutable that can be tailored to different environments and budgets, making me appreciate the vast possibilities I had been missing before diving into AWS.

## How to Prepare

### My Background

As a backend developer who worked on a healthcare system project for a US tech company, I had about six months of experience developing with AWS, including creating a Billing report system that used Event Bridge to trigger Lambda functions for executing Athena Queries. This system would then read data from a specified S3, convert it to CSV, and send it to a designated S3 path. 

This experience made me realize the diversity and power of AWS services, and even after the company shifted AWS service management to DevOps, I decided to continue learning about AWS and get certified to keep up with technological trends.

### Preparation Time and Materials

It took me about three months to prepare. Having some experience with AWS services like Lambda, EC2, and API Gateway, I chose the AWS Certified Developer certification. I soon discovered that my knowledge was insufficient, as the company only utilized a fraction of these services' capabilities.

I bought the highly-rated Udemy course [Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2024 NEW DVA-C02](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) which is 33 hours long. Despite the course's length, I believe in building knowledge gradually. I spent about 1.5 to 2 hours each night after work, taking screenshots and highlighting key points for review. This course covered nearly all the services required for the exam, but I also supplemented my study with practice exams from Udemy's [AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-amazon-dva-c01/) which are known to be tougher than the actual exam. Despite not achieving the passing score on these practice exams initially, I meticulously reviewed the solutions and made notes, which were crucial for my preparation.

### Registering for the Exam

After completing five practice exams, I decided to register for the actual exam. I recommend registering at least two days in advance, as I was left with limited time slots due to late registration. The online proctored exam allows you to take the exam from home, but requires a microphone, speakers, and a webcam for real-time monitoring. Non-native English speakers can get an extra 30 minutes, bringing the total exam time to 170 minutes. It's crucial not to leave your seat during the exam, so plan bathroom visits and hydration accordingly.

### Summarize

#### 1. Study Approach:

- DDedicating 1.5 to 2 hours each night for studying and review, small efforts accumulate. Preparing for this type of exam usually takes 1 to 3 months.
- Emphasized on understanding and noting key points from the course and practice exams.
- Identified areas needing improvement through practice exams, focusing on the topics that appear most frequently on the practice exams.

#### 2. Exam Registration and Tips

- Registration Advice: Register at least 2 days in advance to secure preferred time slots.
- Exam Format: Online proctored exam requiring specific technical setup (microphone, speakers, webcam).
- Exam Day: Avoid drinking water one hour before the exam to prevent discomfort from needing to urinate during the exam. Remember, you cannot leave your seat during the exam, nor can you finish the exam early.

### Final Words

Finally, I would like to share [my AWS preparation notes](https://noteanchiao0417.notion.site/AWS-644b9f32d2f84cd9a5379594aa88d6a0?pvs=4). I recorded all the key answers from the practice exams based on service categories, and thoroughly reviewed these notes before the final exam. Ultimately, this helped me pass the exam!

Best wishes for a successful exam and in achieving your certification!
